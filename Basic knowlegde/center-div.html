This new AI tool will change video creation forever
Do watch this video,
Guess it was created entirely by OpenAI's Sora with a single line of text commands

Recently, OpenAI has announced new AI tool named SORA, which creates videos by some text command prompt.

Making videos will never be the same again.
We can instantly create hyper-realistic videos like these with two lines of text commands.


But wait, it is still in the development stage and has not been released to the public yet.
But like ChatGPT, it will also be available to the general public in the future.


So let me know, whether you are excited for SORA or not, in the comments section.
And if it is useful then like this video and subscribe for more tech news.
